Then you will give a talho from behind, from low to high, moving the right foot forward at the same time, and stopping with the montante in right angle in front of the face. From there you will remove the montante to give a revez cutting from behind with the other edge of the montante, also from low to high, and at the same time moving the left foot forward, and stopping also with the montante in front of the face.
